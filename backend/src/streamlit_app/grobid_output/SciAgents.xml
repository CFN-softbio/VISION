<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>A key challenge in artificial intelligence is the creation of systems capable of autonomously advancing scientific understanding by exploring novel domains, identifying complex patterns, and uncovering previously unseen connections in vast scientific data. In this work, we present SciAgents, an approach that leverages three core concepts: (1) the use of large-scale ontological knowledge graphs to organize and interconnect diverse scientific concepts, (2) a suite of large language models (LLMs) and data retrieval tools, and (3) multi-agent systems with in-situ learning capabilities. Applied to biologically inspired materials, SciAgents reveals hidden interdisciplinary relationships that were previously considered unrelated, achieving a scale, precision, and exploratory power that surpasses traditional human-driven research methods. The framework autonomously generates and refines research hypotheses, elucidating underlying mechanisms, design principles, and unexpected material properties. By integrating these capabilities in a modular fashion, the intelligent system yields material discoveries, critique and improve existing hypotheses, retrieve up-to-date data about existing research, and highlights their strengths and limitations. Our case studies demonstrate scalable capabilities to combine generative AI, ontological representations, and multi-agent modeling, harnessing a 'swarm of intelligence' similar to biological systems. This provides new avenues for materials discovery and accelerates the development of advanced materials by unlocking Nature's design principles.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>One of the grand challenges in the evolving landscape of scientific discovery is finding ways to model, understand, and utilize information mined from diverse sources as a foundation for further research progress and new science discovery. Traditionally, this has been the domain of human researchers who review background knowledge, draft hypotheses, assess and test these hypotheses through various methods (in silico or in vitro), and refine them based on their findings. While these conventional approaches have led to breakthroughs throughout the history of science, they are constrained by the researcher's ingenuity and background knowledge, potentially limiting discovery to the bounds of human imagination. Additionally, conventional human-driven methods are inadequate for exploring the vast amount of existing scientific data to extrapolate knowledge toward entirely novel ideas specially for multi-disciplinary areas like bio-inspired materials design where a common goal is to extract principles from Nature's toolbox and bring it to bear towards engineering applications.</p><p>The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies presents a potential promising solution by enabling the analysis and synthesis of large datasets beyond human capability, which could significantly accelerate discovery by uncovering patterns and connections that are not immediately obvious to human researchers <ref type="bibr">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr">2,</ref><ref type="bibr">3,</ref><ref type="bibr">4,</ref><ref type="bibr">5]</ref>. Therefore, there is great interest in developing AI systems that can not only explore and exploit existing knowledge to make significant scientific discoveries but also automate and replicate the broader research process, including acquiring relevant knowledge and data <ref type="bibr">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr">7,</ref><ref type="bibr">8,</ref><ref type="bibr">9,</ref><ref type="bibr">10]</ref>.</p><p>Large language models (LLMs), such as OpenAI's GPT series <ref type="bibr">[11]</ref>, have demonstrated remarkable progress in diverse domains, driven by their robust capabilities <ref type="bibr">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr">13,</ref><ref type="bibr">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>. These foundational general-purpose AI models <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr">11]</ref> have been increasingly applied in scientific analysis, where they facilitate the generation of new ideas and hypotheses, offering solutions to some of the intrinsic limitations of conventional human-driven methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>. Despite their successes, significant challenges persist regarding their ability to achieve the level of expertise possessed by domain specialists without extensive specialized training. Common issues include their tendency to produce inaccurate responses when dealing with questions that fall outside their initial training scope, and broader concerns about accountability, explainability, and transparency. These problems underscore the potential risks associated with the generation of misleading or even harmful content, requiring us to think about strategies that increase their problem-solving and reasoning capabilities.</p><p>In response to these challenges, in-context learning emerges as a compelling strategy to enhance the performance of LLMs without the need for costly and time-intensive fine-tuning. This approach exploits the model's inherent ability to adapt its responses based on the context embedded within the prompt, which can be derived from a variety of sources. This capability enables LLMs to execute a wide array of tasks effectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>. The potential to construct powerful generative AI models that integrate external knowledge to provide context and elicit more precise responses during generation is substantial <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. The central challenge is to develop robust mechanisms for the accurate retrieval and integration of relevant knowledge that enables LLMs to interpret and synthesize information pertinent to specific tasks, particularly in the realm of scientific discovery.</p><p>The construction of knowledge bases and the strategic retrieval of information from them are gaining traction as effective methods to enhance the generative capabilities of LLMs. Recent advancements in generative AI allow for the efficient mining of vast scientific datasets, transforming unstructured natural language into structured data such as comprehensive ontological knowledge graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>. These knowledge graphs not only provide a mechanistic breakdown of information but also offer an ontological framework that elucidates the interconnectedness of different concepts, delineated as nodes and edges within the graph.</p><p>While single-LLM-based agents can generate more accurate responses when enhanced with well-designed prompts and context, they often fall short for the complex demands of scientific discovery. Creating new scientific insights involves a series of steps, deep thinking, and the integration of diverse, sometimes conflicting information, making it a challenging task for a single agent. To overcome these limitations and fully leverage AI in automating scientific discovery, it's essential to employ a team of specialized agents. Multi-agent AI systems are known for their ability to tackle complex problems across different domains by pooling their capabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>. This collaborative approach allows the system to handle the intricacies of scientific discovery more effectively, potentially leading to breakthroughs that are difficult to achieve by single agents alone.</p><p>Building on these insights, our study introduces a method that synergizes the strengths of ontological knowledge graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref> with the dynamic capabilities of LLM-based multi-agent systems, setting a robust foundation for enhancing graph reasoning and automating the scientific discovery process. Within this generative framework, the discovery workflow is systematically broken down into more manageable subtasks. Each agent in the system is assigned a distinct role, optimized through complex prompting strategies to ensure that every subtask is tackled with targeted expertise and precision. This strategic division of labor allows the AI system to proficiently manage the complexities of scientific research, fostering effective collaboration among agents. This collaboration is crucial for generating, refining, and critically evaluating new hypotheses against essential criteria like novelty and feasibility.</p><p>Central to our hypothesis generation is the utilization of a large ontological knowledge graph, focusing on biological materials, and developed from around 1,000 scientific papers in this domain <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>. We implemented a novel sampling strategy to extract relevant sub-graphs from this comprehensive knowledge graph, allowing us to identify and understand the key concepts and their interrelationships. This rich, contextually informed backdrop is crucial for guiding the agents in generating well-informed and innovative hypotheses. Such a method not only improves the accuracy of hypothesis generation but also ensures that these hypotheses are solidly rooted in a comprehensive knowledge framework. This structured approach promises to enhance the impact and relevance of scientific discoveries by ensuring they are well-informed and methodologically sound.</p><p>The plan of the paper is as follows. In Section 2, we discuss our proposed LLM-powered multi-agent system for automated scientific discovery, outlining its main components and constitutive agents. Two approaches are discussed and compared: One based on pre-programmed AI-AI interactions, and another one utilizing a fully automated framework in which a set of agents self-organize to solve problems. Several examples are provided to illustrate the different aspects of our approach, from path generation to research hypothesis generation and critique, demonstrating the system's potential to explore novel scientific concepts and produce innovative ideas by synthesizing an iterative prompting strategy during which multiple LLMs work together. Section 3 then presents the key findings and discussing the implications of our multi-agent system for future research in scientific discovery.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Results and discussion</head><p>LLMs have demonstrated a relatively high level of proficiency across a wide range of tasks, including question answering, hypothesis development, summarizing and contrasting ideas, processing complex information, executing tasks, and even writing code. However, conventional inference strategies often fail to produce sophisticated reasoning and detail in the generated data. By using a set of interacting models, and assigning distinct roles to LLM-based agents, effective multi-agent AI systems can be constructed. When combined with carefully crafted prompts and in-context learning from graph representation of data, these systems are capable of generating scientific ideas and hypotheses. We now present results from a several experiments we conducted with our proposed framework (details about implementation, see Materials and Methods section).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Multi-agent system for graph reasoning and scientific discovery</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> illustrates the outline of our proposed multi-agent model designed to automate the scientific discovery process based on the key concepts and relationships retrieved from a comprehensive knowledge graph developed from scientific papers (Figure <ref type="figure">1a</ref>). This figure further showcases two distinct strategies deployed in this study for generating novel scientific hypotheses, both of which harness the collective intelligence of a team of agents. These strategies integrate the specialized capabilities of each agent, systematically exploring uncharted research territories to produce innovative and high-impact scientific hypotheses. The full description of the agents incorporated in SciAgents is listed in Figures <ref type="figure">S1-S4</ref> in the Supporting Information.</p><p>The key difference between these approaches lies in the nature of the interaction between the agents. In the first approach (Figure <ref type="figure">1b</ref>), the interactions between agents are pre-programmed and follow a predefined sequence of tasks that ensure consistency and reliability in hypothesis generation. In contrast, the second approach features fully automated agent interactions without any predetermined order of how interactions between agents unfold, providing a more flexible and adaptive framework that can dynamically respond to the evolving context of the research process. This second strategy (Figure <ref type="figure">1c</ref>) also incorporates human-in-the-loop interactions, enabling human intervention at various stages of research development. Such interventions allow for expert feedback, refinement of hypotheses, or strategic guidance, specification about certain materials, types or features, ultimately enhancing the quality and relevance of the generated scientific ideas. Moreover, the second approach provides a more robust framework where additional tools could be readily incorporated. For instance, we have empowered our automated multi-agent model with the Semantic Scholar API as a tool that provides it with an ability to check the novelty of the generated hypothesis against the existing literature.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">2</ref> shows an overview of the entire process from initial keyword selection to the final document. We employ a hierarchical expansion strategy where answers are successively refined and improved, enriched with retrieved data, critiqued and amended by identification or critical modeling, simulation and experimental tasks and adversarial prompting. The process begins with initial keyword identification or random exploration within a graph, followed by path sampling to create a subgraph of relevant concepts and relationships. This subgraph forms the basis for generating structured output in JSON following a specific set of aspects that the model is tasked to develop. These include the hypothesis, outcome, mechanisms, design principles, unexpected properties, comparison, and novelty. Each component is subsequently expanded on with individual prompting, to yield significant amount of additional detail, forming a comprehensive draft. This draft then undergoes a critical review process, including amendments for modeling and simulation priorities (e.g., molecular dynamics) and experimental priorities (e.g., synthetic biology). The final integrated draft, along with critical analyses, results in a document that can guide further scientific inquiry.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>: Overview of the multi-agent graph-reasoning system developed here. Panel a, overview of graph construction, as reported in <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>. The visual shows the progression from scientific papers as data source to graph construction, with the image on the right showing a zoomed-in view of the graph. Panels b and c: Two distinct approaches are presented: In b, A multi-agent system based on pre-programmed sequence of interactions between agents, ensuring consistency and reliability, and in c, a fully automated, flexible multi-agent framework that adapts dynamically to the evolving research context. Both systems leverage a sampled path within a global knowledge graph as context to guide the research idea generation process. Each agent plays a specialized role: The Ontologist defines key concepts and relationships, Scientist 1 crafts a detailed research proposal, Scientist 2 expands and refines the proposal, and the Critic agent conducts a thorough review and suggests improvements. The Planner in the second approach develops a detailed plan and the assistant is instructed to check the novelty of the generated research hypotheses. This collaborative framework enables the generation of innovative and well-rounded scientific hypotheses that extend beyond conventional human-driven methods.</p><p>In the following, we explore the primary components of our multi-agent strategy. For better clarity and understanding, each section is accompanied by practical examples from a sample hypothesis. This hypothesis was generated using "silk" and "energy-intensive" as the starting nodes. The outcomes of this experiment are presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3</ref>. For a more detailed illustration, see the Supplementary Information.</p><p>1-Path generation. At the core of our model is an expansive knowledge graph, first introduced in <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>, that encompasses the fields of bio-inspired materials and mechanics. This knowledge graph integrates a variety of concepts and knowledge domains, enabling the exploration of hypotheses that once seemed disconnected. To augment the capabilities of our underlying large language model (LLM), we provide it with a sub-graph derived from this more extensive knowledge graph. This sub-graph depicts a pathway that connects two crucial concepts or nodes within the comprehensive graph. The construction of this path is crucial; Unlike in earlier work <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref> where the shortest path was utilized, our study employs a random path approach. As illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>, the random approach infuses the path with a richer array of concepts and relationships, enabling our agents to explore a broader spectrum of domains, as opposed to the shortest path where only a few concepts are included. This expanded exploration not only enhances the depth and breadth of insights gained but also fosters the novelty of the hypotheses generated. Initially, the two concepts can be either specified by the user or selected randomly by the model from the knowledge graph. For instance, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">2</ref>: Overview of the entire process from initial keyword selection to the final document, following a hierarchical expansion strategy where answers are successively refined and improved, enriched with retrieved data, critiqued and amended by identification or critical modeling, simulation and experimental tasks. The process begins with initial keyword identification or random exploration within a graph, followed by path sampling to create a subgraph of relevant concepts and relationships (see, Figure <ref type="figure">S1</ref>, for an illustration of how the path can be sampled). This subgraph forms the basis for generating structured output in JSON, including the hypothesis, outcome, mechanisms, design principles, unexpected properties, comparison, and novelty. Each component is subsequently expanded on with individual prompting, to yield significant amount of additional detail, forming a comprehensive draft. This draft then undergoes a critical review process, including amendments for modeling and simulation priorities (e.g., molecular dynamics) and experimental priorities (e.g., synthetic biology). The final integrated draft, along with critical analyses, results in a document that guides further scientific inquiry.</p><p>the example below demonstrates the path generated by the model between the concepts "silk" and "energy-intensive". Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref> shows additional knowledge graphs derived from random sampling for randomly chosen concepts to provide additional examples. We refer the reader to Figure <ref type="figure">S1</ref> for a visualization of how path sampling can be conducted between two predetermined nodes, or randomly selected pairs of nodes.</p><p>silk -&gt; provides -&gt; biocompatibility -&gt; possess -&gt; biological materials -&gt; has -&gt; multifunctionality -&gt; include -&gt; self-cleaning -&gt; include -&gt; multifunctionality -&gt; broad applicability in biomaterial design -&gt; silk -&gt; possess -&gt; biopolymers -&gt; possess -&gt; silk -&gt; is -&gt; fibroin -&gt; is -&gt; silk -&gt; broad applicability in biomaterial design -&gt; multifunctionality -&gt; include -&gt; structural coloration -&gt; exhibited by -&gt; insects -&gt; are -&gt; energy-intensive</p><p>The generated path provides an analytical representation of various concepts and their interconnections, which were previously unrelated. By delineating these relationships, the model gains the ability to perceive and analyze connections between concepts that have not been explicitly linked before. This innovative mapping approach enables the model to extrapolate and generate ideas that are both novel and potentially transformative, paving the way for breakthroughs in understanding and application.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2-Deep Insights with LLM-Based Analysis</head><p>Utilizing our LLM-powered ontologist agent, we move deeper into the intricacies of the relationships that have been mapped out in the earlier path generation stage. By examining the connections and nuances among the identified concepts, the agent helps transition from static knowledge retrieval to dynamic knowledge generation. This crucial shift is what enables the model to identify gaps in existing research and propose new angles of inquiry, thereby laying the groundwork for novel ideas and hypotheses. In this context, the role of the ontologist agent is instrumental. It applies advanced reasoning and inference techniques to synthesize and interpret the complex web of data. This capability allows it to extract significant insights that might not be obvious at first glance, offering a richer, more detailed understanding of the relationships. </p></div>

The difference between nodes and edges sampled in the two approaches is apparent, where enhanced sampling invokes a host of additional concepts that will be incorporated into research development. The richer substrate that forms the basis for agentic reasoning yields more sophisticated research concepts. Agentic reasoning carefully assesses the ideas and negotiate, via adverserial interactions between the agents, a sound prediction and carefully delineated research ideas <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref>.</p><p>As an example, here are some of the insights into the relationships as identified by the ontologist for the aforementioned path, demonstrating how our approach not only maps out but also meaningfully interprets complex datasets to generate scientific hypotheses.</p><p>-**Silk -possess -biopolymers**: Silk is a type of biopolymer, a natural polymer produced by living organisms.</p><p>-**Biopolymers -possess -silk**: This reiterates that silk is a biopolymer. -**Silk -can be spun into -membranes**: Silk can be processed and spun into thin layers or sheets known as membranes.</p><p>-**Membranes -can be spun into -silk**: This indicates the reverse process, where membranes can be derived from silk.</p><p>-**Silk -broad applicability in biomaterial design -multifunctionality**: Silk's multifunctional properties make it highly applicable in the design of biomaterials.</p><p>-**High adhesion -include -multifunctionality**: This indicates that high adhesion is part of the multifunctional nature of silk.</p><p>-**Structural coloration -exhibited by -insects**: Insects, such as those that produce silk, often exhibit structural coloration.</p><p>-**Insects -are -energy-intensive**: The processes involving insects, including silk production, can be energy-intensive.</p><p>The results demonstrate that the model has developed a reasonably refined understanding of relationships between seemingly unrelated concepts. This capability enables the model to support reasoning in scientific research and propose new research hypotheses, which will be further explored in the subsequent stage.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3-Research Hypothesis Generation and Expansion</head><p>This stage is where the effects of our multi-agent system emerges. The scientist agent harnesses the extensive knowledge parsed from the knowledge graph and further refined by the ontologist to propose novel research ideas. Through complex prompting, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>, the agent is assigned specific roles and is tasked with synthesizing a novel research proposal that integrates all key concepts from the knowledge graph. The designated agent, Scientist_1, is configured to deliver a detailed hypothesis that is both innovative and logically grounded, aiming to advance the understanding or application of the provided concepts. The agent creates a proposal that carefully addresses the following seven key aspects: hypothesis, outcome, mechanisms, design principles, unexpected properties, comparison, and novelty. This approach ensures a thorough exploration and evaluation of the new scientific idea, allowing for a detailed assessment of its feasibility, potential impact, and areas of innovation.</p><p>The proficiency of the Scientist_1 LLM agent in generating novel research hypotheses is demonstrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3</ref>.</p><p>The concept involves integrating silk with dandelion-based pigments to create biomaterials with enhanced optical and mechanical properties. The proposed enhancement in mechanical properties stems from a hierarchical organization of silk combined with the reinforcing effects of the pigments. According to the model, this proposed composite material could exhibit significantly improved mechanical strength, reaching up to 1.5 GPa compared to traditional silk materials, which range from 0.5 to 1.0 GPa. Additionally, the use of low-temperature processing and dandelion pigments is projected to reduce energy consumption by approximately 30%. This example underscores the potential of translating knowledge graphs into unprecedented material designs, facilitating a seamless transition from theoretical data to practical applications in materials science.</p><p>The research idea proposed by Scientist_1 provides a foundational abstract for a more detailed research proposal that is developed through subsequent agentic interactions. To enhance and deepen this initial concept, Scientist_2 is tasked with rigorously expanding upon and critically assessing the idea's various components. This agent is specifically instructed to integrate, wherever possible, quantitative scientific information such as chemical formulas, numerical values, protein sequences, and processing conditions, significantly enriching the proposal's scientific depth and accuracy. Additionally, Scientist_2 is directed to comment on specific modeling and simulation techniques tailored to the project's needs, such as simulations for material behavior analysis or experimental methods. This thorough review and enhancement process, including clear rationale and step-by-step reasoning, ensures that the research proposal is robust, well-grounded, and ready for further development. This systematic approach not only solidifies the scientific underpinnings of the proposal but also prepares it for successful implementation and future exploration.</p><p>The expanded research idea provided by Scientist_2 is showcased in the Supplementary Information, revealing a thorough rationale and sequential reasoning for various aspects of the research proposal. Here are selected key points to exemplify the model's contributions:</p><p>• The model suggests using Molecular Dynamics (MD) Simulations to explore interactions at the molecular level. Specifically, it proposes employing software like GROMACS or AMBER to model how silk fibroin interacts with dandelion pigments, aiming to understand the self-assembly processes and predict the resulting microstructures. Ensure your scientific hypothesis is both innovative and grounded in logical reasoning, capable of advancing our understanding or application of the concepts provided.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 5:</head><p>The profile of the Scientist_1 LLM agent implemented in the first proposed multi-agent approach for automated scientific discovery. The AI agent utilizes the definitions of concepts and relationships between them in the knowledge graph provided by the Ontologist to generate a novel research hypothesis.</p><p>• For potential applications of the new composite material, the model identifies its suitability for bio-inspired adhesives. It highlights how the dynamic interactions between silk proteins and pigments may impart selfhealing properties, making these materials ideal for adhesives that can repair themselves after damage.</p><p>• Regarding the mechanisms that contribute to enhanced material properties, the model points out the reinforcing effect of the pigments. It suggests that these pigments could improve the tensile strength and toughness of the composite material, with plans to conduct mechanical testing, including tensile and nanoindentation tests, to quantify these properties.</p><p>• A detailed comparison with existing materials is also provided by the model as summarized in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. It notes that traditional silk materials typically exhibit tensile strengths ranging from 0.5 to 1.0 GPa, whereas the proposed composite material aims to achieve up to 1.5 GPa. This enhancement is attributed to the hierarchical organization of silk proteins and the reinforcing effect of dandelion-derived pigments. Further, it details how silk fibroin's molecular structure, with repetitive sequences of glycine and alanine forming β-sheet crystallites, contributes to its mechanical properties. The integration of dandelion pigments, possibly including bioactive compounds such as taraxasterol and luteolin, is expected to further enhance these properties through intermolecular interactions and cross-linking, providing a synergistic effect at multiple scales.</p><p>• As summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, the model proposes the following design principles: It utilizes the natural multiscale organization of silk fibroin to guide the self-assembly of dandelion pigments, leveraging hierarchical structuring from the nano to the macro scale. This organization is critical for achieving both the desired mechanical strength and vibrant structural coloration.

Each agent has a specific role and focus in the system which is described by a unique profile. Our team of agents with the following entities collaborate in a dynamic environment to create a research proposal:</p><p>• "Human": human user that poses the task and can intervene at various stages of the problem solving process.</p><p>• "Planner": suggests a detailed plan to solve the task.</p><p>• "Ontologist": who is responsible to define the relationships and concepts within the knowledge graph.</p><p>• "Scientist 1": crafts the initial draft of a detailed research hypothesis with seven key items based on the definitions provided by Ontologist. • "Scientist 2": who expands and refines the different key aspects of the research proposal created by Scientist 1.</p><p>• "Critic": conducts a thorough review and suggests improvements.</p><p>• "Assistant": has access to external tools including a function to generate a knowledge path from two keywords and a function to assess the novelty and feasibility of the research idea. • "Group chat manager": chooses the next speaker based on the context and agent profiles and broadcasts the message to the whole group.</p><p>Despite the varied dynamics in agentic AI-AI interactions, the overall pipeline of the two proposed agent-based systems to generate research hypotheses from concepts and relationships derived from a knowledge graph is similar. As illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">7</ref> the automated multi-agent collaboration starts with a plan from the planner detailing the steps required to accomplish the task posed by the human which involves creating a research hypothesis from given keywords or randomly selected by the model. Next, the assistant agent calls the appropriate function to establish a pathway which serves as the foundational knowledge graph for subsequent analysis. The ontologist agent then discusses definitions and relationships. This sets the stage for scientist_1 to generate a research idea, which is then expanded by scientist_2. The sequence concludes with a summary, critical review, and suggestions for improvement by the critic agent.

Despite the similarity in the steps followed by the agents in each approach, the results show that while the generated hypotheses share overall concepts and methodologies, they differ in the details. For example, in the analysis of the research hypothesis highlighted earlier, both models emphasize integrating silk with dandelion pigments, but they differ in specifics such as their scope of application and the depth of technical aspects regarding material fabrication and potential uses. For comparison, the full document created by the automated multi-agent model using the same knowledge graph between "silk" and "energy-intensive" is provided in Section S2 of the Supplementary Material.</p><p>The difference stems from the subtle differences in how the data is propagated between the agents in the two approaches. In the first approach, during the generation process, the agents receive only a filtered subset of information from previous interactions (see <ref type="bibr">4</ref>.3 for more details). In contrast, the second approach allows agents to share memory, giving them access to all the content generated in previous interactions. This means they operate with full visibility of the history of their collaboration. Another difference between the two models is that the second approach benefits from the integration of a tool that assesses the novelty of the proposed research ideas against current literature, using Semantic Scholar API. This feature enables us to effectively measure the novelty of the research and proactively eliminate any ideas that are too similar to existing work.</p><p>To demonstrate the efficacy of the automated multi-agent model in generating novel research ideas and evaluating their novelty and feasibility, we conducted five experiments, tasking the automated multi-agent model with constructing research ideas. We summarized these hypotheses in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">4</ref>, which includes details about each research idea, the proposed hypotheses, expected outcomes, and assessments of novelty and feasibility. These research ideas are generated based on randomly selected concepts from the knowledge graph. Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref> displays the generated knowledge graphs, showcasing a diverse array of concepts and relationships. Some nodes like "biomaterials", "hierarchical structure", and "mechanical properties" show high node degree and serve as central hubs, indicating their pivotal roles in interconnecting various scientific disciplines within the graph. The results highlight the diversity of the research hypotheses, which stems from both the random selection of endpoint nodes and the paths between them. Moreover, the results showcase varying levels of novelty and feasibility, as assessed against current literature, underscoring the critical role of comparing with existing knowledge. The process of exploring a variety of paths, scoring the results, and identifying the most promising directions could easily be scaled over thousands of iterations, yielding a very large ideation database.</p></div>

The primary goal is to find a path between a source and a target node by estimating distances using node embeddings. The embeddings are generated using a pre-trained model and are crucial for the heuristic function, which estimates the distance between the current node and the target node. By relying on these embeddings, the algorithm adapts to the topological structure of the graph, allowing it to effectively traverse complex networks. Additionally, the algorithm uses a modified version of Dijkstra's algorithm that introduces a randomness factor to the priority queue, creating paths that are not strictly deterministic <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. We chose the randomness factor to be 0.2 in our experiments.</p><p>An additional feature of the algorithm is the introduction of random waypoints to diversify the pathfinding process. These waypoints are selected from neighboring nodes that are not part of the initial path, enabling the algorithm to explore alternative routes. The randomization factor controls the balance between heuristic-driven search and stochastic exploration, making it flexible for different use cases. After the path is found, a subgraph consisting of the path nodes and their second-hop neighbors is generated, providing a broader context for the discovered route. The resulting paths are then used as substrate for graph reasoning.</p><p>The overall approach is as follows:</p></div>

If the shortest_path flag is set to True, the function computes the shortest path between these nodes by using embeddings to estimate the best-fitting nodes, leveraging a pre-existing function called find_path. If shortest_path is set to False, a heuristic pathfinding approach is employed, which incorporates randomization and potentially random waypoints to explore more diverse paths. The graph structure is used not only for identifying the connectivity between the nodes but also for guiding the algorithm's search for the most relevant or exploratory paths based on the node embeddings.</p><p>Once a path between keyword_1 and keyword_2 is established, the function constructs a knowledge graph from the path and its relationships. This knowledge graph consists of the nodes traversed and the relationships (edges) between them. The graph's structure is vital as it is used to form the input for a generative model, which expands on the graph's nodes and relationships by providing definitions and explanations. The function also generates a novel research hypothesis by analyzing the graph, synthesizing a hypothesis based on the relationships and concepts discovered along the path. The structure of the graph helps to frame the scientific inquiry, with the hypothesis leveraging the graph's connections to predict outcomes, explore mechanisms, and propose innovative ideas. This output is formatted as a JSON object with fields like "hypothesis", "outcome", and "design_principles", each reflecting different aspects of the potential research grounded in the graph's topology.</p><p>A key aspect of the process is the use of natural language generation to dynamically expand on the concepts represented by the nodes and edges of the knowledge graph. For each node, the generative model provides detailed definitions and explanations of the scientific concepts it represents. The relationships between the nodes, represented by the edges, are also expanded to give context to how these concepts are interconnected. This approach not only builds a deeper understanding of individual components of the graph but also enhances the user's ability to interpret the complex interrelations between them, thereby setting the foundation for novel scientific inquiry. The response generated by the model includes comprehensive descriptions of these relationships, ensuring that the resulting graph becomes a robust substrate for knowledge synthesis.</p><p>After the knowledge graph is expanded, the algorithm generates a structured scientific hypothesis that leverages each of the nodes and relationships in the graph. The output, in JSON format, provides key fields such as "mechanisms", "unexpected_properties", and "comparison", offering a highly detailed analysis. The "mechanisms" field discusses predicted chemical, biological, or physical interactions, while "unexpected_properties" anticipates emergent behaviors from novel combinations of concepts in the graph. This comprehensive hypothesis formulation process allows for the exploration of unexplored areas of study, providing an innovative and grounded approach to scientific discovery based on the structure of the graph and its conceptual relationships.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.2">Expansion of the initial concepts</head><p>The final phase of the methodology focuses on leveraging the expanded research concept to identify key scientific questions and prioritize actionable research directions, particularly in the domains of molecular modeling and synthetic biology. This phase employs a generative model to analyze the complete research document, which includes the knowledge graph, expanded concepts, and critical reviews, with the goal of extracting the most impactful scientific questions.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Step 1: Prompt-Driven Expansion of Key Research Aspects</head><p>The next phase involves systematically expanding specific aspects of the hypothesis using a series of targeted prompts. For each aspect of the research, a detailed prompt is constructed to critically assess and improve the scientific content of that aspect. The primary aspects are drawn from the JSON dictionary, where we iterate over all elements in that data structure.</p><p>The following steps summarize how the model expands each research aspect:</p><p>• A prompt is created for each field in the JSON data structure, asking the model to expand upon the original content by adding quantitative details such as chemical formulas, material properties, or specific experimental methods.</p><p>The model is also instructed to provide a step-by-step rationale for the proposed scientific improvements. • For example, the prompt format includes:</p><p>Expand on the following aspect: {field}. Critically assess the original content, add specifics, such as chemical formulas, sequences, microstructures, and rational improvements: {JSON_dictionary[field]}</p><p>• The model generates expanded content under a heading such as ### Expanded Mechanisms or ### Expanded Outcomes. Each response is added to res_data_expanded to track the expanded fields. • The iterative process is repeated for each of the first seven fields in res_data, ensuring that every major aspect of the research concept is thoroughly evaluated and improved upon.</p><p>Step 2: Compilation and Summary of Expanded Content</p><p>After the expansion phase, the system compiles the results into a structured document, starting with the original knowledge graph and hypothesis, followed by the expanded research aspects. This forms a cohesive research narrative.

The review is designed to evaluate both the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed research and to suggest improvements. This step is crucial in ensuring that the expanded content is scientifically rigorous and logical. The prompt asks for:</p><p>Provide a thorough critical scientific review with strengths, weaknesses, and suggested improvements.</p><p>The result is a critical review that is appended to the final document as "SUMMARY, CRITICAL REVIEW, AND IMPROVEMENTS".</p><p>Step 4: Identification of Modeling and Experimental Priorities</p><p>Finally, the model is prompted to identify the most impactful scientific questions related to molecular modeling and synthetic biology.</p><p>Separate prompts are issued for each domain, asking the model to:</p><p>• Identify a key research question that can be tackled using molecular modeling, and outline steps to conduct such modeling, including any specific tools or techniques. • Similarly, for synthetic biology, the model is prompted to outline an experimental plan, detailing unique aspects such as gene-editing protocols, biological sequences, or organism-specific techniques.</p><p>Examples of these prompts:</p><p>Identify the single most impactful scientific question that can be tackled with molecular modeling.</p><p>Outline key steps for conducting such modeling.</p><p>Identify the most impactful question for synthetic biology and provide an experimental setup.</p><p>The responses are appended to the final document under "MODELING AND SIMULATION PRIORITIES" and "SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY EXPERIMENTAL PRIORITIES".</p></div>

Specifically, we propose that the binding of graphene to amyloid fibrils will result in a composite material with superior electrical conductivity and stability, which can be further controlled and optimized through engineered gene circuits that regulate the expression, secretion, and assembly of the amyloid-forming proteins.</p><p>Literature Review Summary</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Graphene and Amyloid Fibrils in Bioelectronics:</head><p>Several studies have explored the use of amyloid fibrils in bioelectronic devices, highlighting their potential due to their robust and well-ordered nanostructures. Graphene has been combined with various materials to enhance electrical properties, including amyloid fibrils, but the specific combination and its applications in bioelectronics are still emerging.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Electrical Conductivity:</head><p>Research has shown that amyloid fibrils can be used to create materials with enhanced electrical conductivity, especially when combined with graphene or other conductive materials.</p><p>Studies have demonstrated the synthesis of graphene nanoribbons from amyloid fibrils, indicating the feasibility of creating conductive composites.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Engineered Gene Circuits:</head><p>There is ongoing research into using synthetic biology and engineered gene circuits to control the assembly and properties of amyloid fibrils. The integration of gene circuits to regulate the expression and assembly of amyloid-forming proteins is a novel approach that has potential but is not yet widely explored in the context of bioelectronic devices.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Novelty and Feasibility Ratings</head><p>Novelty: 8/10</p><p>The hypothesis presents a novel integration of graphene and amyloid fibrils for bioelectronic applications, with an innovative approach of using engineered gene circuits to control the material properties. While there is some existing research on similar topics, the specific combination and proposed applications are sufficiently novel.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Feasibility: 7/10</head><p>The feasibility of creating graphene-amyloid composites with enhanced electrical properties is supported by existing research. However, the implementation of engineered gene circuits to control these properties adds complexity and requires further validation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recommendation</head><p>The proposed research hypothesis is both novel and feasible, with a strong potential to contribute significantly to the field of bioelectronics. The integration of graphene and amyloid fibrils, combined with the innovative use of engineered gene circuits, presents a promising avenue for developing advanced bioelectronic devices. Further experimental validation and optimization will be necessary to fully realize this potential. TERMINATE</p></div>			</div>

	<note>This enhancement is expected to be due to the alignment of amyloid fibrils, which can facilitate electron transport. Quantitative Conductivity Improvement: We anticipate that the electrical conductivity of the graphene-amyloid fibril composite will be significantly higher than that of pure graphene or amyloid fibrils alone. For instance, if pure graphene has a conductivity of ~10^4 S/m, the composite could achieve conductivities in the range of 10^5 to 10^6 S/m. 3. Stability and Durability: Structural Stability: The hypothesis includes the expectation that the graphene-amyloid fibril composite will exhibit enhanced structural stability compared to pure graphene. This stability can be assessed through mechanical testing, such as tensile strength and Young&apos;s modulus measurements. Durability Under Conditions: We hypothesize that the composite will maintain its electrical properties under various environmental conditions, including changes in temperature, humidity, and mechanical stress. This can be tested through accelerated aging experiments and cyclic loading tests</note>
